  <TM_ElephantBow.description>A bow shaped from elephant tusks.

  <TM_ThrumBow.label>Thrum Bow</TM_ThrumBow.label>
  <TM_ThrumBow.description>A bow shaped from the horn of a Thrumbo. The horn is hallowed out to decrease the weight and softened by soaking it in a magicyte compound that adds a surprising suppleness to the horn. The bow is further enhanced with embedded enchantments and arcane engravings that travel the length of the bow. The bow is said to be almost sentient, able to determine the intended target through a mental link with the wielder. Arrows fired from this bow almost always hit their intended target. This effect does have a tendency to delude the users own capability, however.
