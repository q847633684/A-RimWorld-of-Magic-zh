  <TableArcaneForge.label>arcane forge</TableArcaneForge.label>
  <TableArcaneForge.description>The arcane forge allows a mage to wield raw arcane power to create material objects. 
	
Scientifically, the arcane forge might be described as a matter fabricator, though the exact mechanics have yet to be determined.  Only those possessing the ability to manipulate arcane power are able to use the arcane forge.

Using the arcane forge dramatically increases crafting speed but consumes mana.  Items of quality are determined by the mage's intelligence skill and class level.</TableArcaneForge.description>

  <TableMagicCircle.label>magic circle</TableMagicCircle.label>
  <TableMagicCircle.description>The magic circle is a construct that amplifies magic by aligning the physical and arcane into a focal point. While it may seem simple, the circle is outlined with elaborate runes and constructed with detailed precision.

Mages can use the magic circle to augment their power or combine their energy with other mages to create unique, powerful effects. The circle may accomodate up to six mages.

The type of material used in construction directly affects the quality of the magic circle.
Stone (any): no bonuses
Steel: no bonus
Wood: no bonus
Jade: success chance +20%
Silver: refunds 20% of material cost
Plasteel: event points +15%
Gold: event points +10%, duration +20%
Uranium: duration and success chance +15%
Arcalleum: success chance +10%, refunds 20% of mana cost

*Admin note: the circle will fuel itself when it detects mages capable of performing the ritual.</TableMagicCircle.description>
