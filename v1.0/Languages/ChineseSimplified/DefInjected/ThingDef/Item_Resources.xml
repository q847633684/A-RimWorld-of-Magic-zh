  <TM_Manaweave.description>Manaweave is cloth that has been fused with magicyte and meticulously imbued with arcane symbols. Manaweave inherits many of the physical properties of cloth, but acquires an additional reactive response to physical force. What makes the fabric unique is its ability to act as a conductor of mana that enhances the effects of enchantments and naturally grants protection against light and dark magic. 

Extremely difficult and taxing to create, only a talented and knowledgeable mage can make this material.</TM_Manaweave.description>

  <!-- Arcalleum -->

  <TM_Arcalleum.label>arcalleum</TM_Arcalleum.label>
  <TM_Arcalleum.description>A metal alloy consisting of steel, jade, silver and magicyte. Its unique composition gives it mystical properties that increased elasticity and creates reverberations of any magical energy transferred through it. The elasticity of the alloy makes it an excellent choice for blunt protection, but is sub-standard for use in weapons. Arcalleum is difficult to create and requires a forge capable of liquefying and combining all ingredients of the alloy.
	
	While arcalluem is sought after for its enhanced defensive properties, it is also prized by fighters and mages alike for its power to nullify the cooldown of any ability. Each kg of arcalleum worn increases the chance an ability cooldown is nullified after use by 1% (50% max).</TM_Arcalleum.description>
